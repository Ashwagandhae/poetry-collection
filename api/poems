Bauer documents his exciting encounters with enthralling objects like flooring materials, writing utensils, rapid transport, and baked goods. While Bauer sometimes connects these exhilarating artifacts to broader themes like Nature and melancholy, he also commonly engages in simple poetic descriptions that shine light on the intricacies of these fabulous fragments. In his poetry, Bauer centers the sound of his poems, focusing on pairing, tripleting, and even quadrupleting phonetic harmonies. This constant contest for consonant consonants fascinates Bauer, motivating his exploration of interesting imagery and the interplay of playful wordplay. \n\nVaried as the items he depicts, Bauer writes his poems with a cornucopia of forms. These include the strict and stumpy haikus and tankas, the elongated villanelles and abecedarians, and the optical augmentations of ekphrasis. In addition to these well-established structures, Bauer includes and a smattering of uniquely architected free form poems—free from form's famous infringements on the formulation of footloose fontology. Bauer usually takes advantage of these forms to strengthen his message. However, we've confirmed sightings of Bauer creating maliciously compliant poems which only grudgingly follow The Rules. \n\nBauer rejects the repression of sections, instead clumping his poetic works into one long menu, starting with his older creations and moving towards more recent ideas. The poems' titles similarly follow no set pattern, though many use simple adjective-nouns to inform or decieve the reader about their poem's contents. Bauer hopes you will enjoy his poetry collection. Finally, Bauer asks: do these paragraphs consider themselves a poem\n\nif they have extra line breaks?"},{"title":"Floor","form":"haiku","theme":{"text":"hsl(10, 50%, 30%)","back":"hsl(25, 60%, 80%)"},"slug":"01 floor.txt","content":"frozen woven waves,\nbrown plumes preserved evermore,\nrootless wormwood floor.","draft":"frozen woven waves\nbrown plumes preserved evermore\nmurdered timber core"},{"title":"Juggler's Struggle","note":"after Karma Juggler by Do Ho Suh, from 2004: Six by Four","form":"ekphrastic","align":"center","theme":{"text":"hsl(359, 81%, 57%)","back":"hsl(0, 0%, 94%)"},"image":"karma.jpeg","slug":"02 karma.txt","content":"rose’s bloom, flower cocoon, flattened legume: the end of a broom\noctopus suction cups, homologous chromatin crust\ncrushed crystals of krill, crab, and karma\nsilky slice of shrub stump\njuggler’s struggle","draft":"roses bloom, flower cocoon, flattened legume, orange plume: the end of a broom\noctopus suction cups, homologous chromatin cluster\ncrushing crystals of krill, crab, and karma\nstunted oak shrub offshoot\njuggler’s struggles\n"},{"title":"Kuchen","theme":{"text":"hsl(340, 80%, 30%)","back":"hsl(45, 60%, 80%)"},"slug":"03 kuchen.txt","content":"1.

Bauer also expresses gratitude to his classmates for their insightful feedback and encouragement throughout the poetry seminar."}]
