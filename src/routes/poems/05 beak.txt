Another plant plucked,
broken off its stem,
cut from life force,
dragged and torn apart: 
elegant angle of 
folding ebony scythes
grappling paper.
Heavy edges engraving:
incisors pressing the
juice from crispy
kicking canopy to 
lumpy doughy pulp. 
Metal boats afloat:
on opposite sides of the 
pool, drowning through
quiet controlled waves to 
restrain the small soft 
sheet. Moving mountains:
tectonic plates shifting 
under closing cliffs, a
valley falling smaller. 
Weighty angle brackets of
XML files, two triangles
yellowing their horizons, 
zig-zags converging closed.

Heavy edges engraving,

Metal boats afloat
on other sides of the 
pool, sinking through
quiet controlled waves to 
restrain the small soft 
sheet. Moving mountains;
tectonic plates shifting 
under the closing cliffs, a
valley growing smaller. 
Weighted angle brackets of
XML standards, two triangles
yellowing their horizons, 
zig-zags converging closed.
