stampede:

rising…
buzzing…
swarming…

chair-chained
glass cage encased
ethereal steel embraced

strides prioritized
they’ll ride to sunrise
dodge jingling demise

tires on a hill
tilted cups before the spill
teardrops hanging from a windowsill

lifted feet ready
blue cards steady
the doors… already?

The stampede

assembling…
gathering…
swarming…

frozen behind the glass cage
trapped behind the metal wall
chained behind the door

poised

like a tire on a hill
like a tilted glass before the spill
like a teardrop hanging from a windowsill

soon they will ride to their sunrise
dodge their jingling demise
grasp their prize
(shiver in the cold?)

they watch the landscape slow…

lifted feet ready
blue cards steady
the doors… already?
