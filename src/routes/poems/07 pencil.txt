Plastic pencil cracked,
twined vitals outside,
cannot craft it back.

Under-hand collapsed,
dusty polymers died,
plastic pencil cracked.

Carved canvas black,
pushed through paper tide,
cannot have it back.

Led hands, wrote paragraphs,
drove the graphite ride,
plastic pencil cracked.

Not shackled to a plaque,
No need for teary eyes
(cannot get it back.)

Final fragments trashed,
silver strings subside—
plastic pencil cracked;
will not have it back.

Plastic pencil cracked
Mechanical metals outside 
I’ll never get it back

weighed down like a yak
degraded by transparent oxide
plastic pencil cracked 

carved through canvas smoky-black
pushing through the paper tide
I’ll never get it back

led my hands through paragraphs
for 2 years my thoughts it did guide
plastic pencil cracked

I won’t preserve it in a plaque
not worthy of a teary eye
I’ll never get it back

A pencil to many pieces hacked
a friend no longer by my side
plastic pencil cracked 
I’ll never get it back
